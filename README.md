## Project Description

The Covid-19 pandemic has introduced unprecedented challenges in the way corporations are being managed. The barrage of ever-changing regulations makes it difficult for businesses to constantly stay updated and ensure adherence to these measures at all times.

Therefore, we present **GR8 Employee Management System** to help corporations operating in office environments manage their human resources better amidst the Covid-19 restrictions.

## Summary of Features

- Companies can **split users into teams** for easier management. Administrators can create teams according to their needs - for example, splitting users by departments in the company or by shifts. 
- Companies can then **schedule** these teamsâ€™ working shifts and mode of work.
- Users can also upload ART results, temperature and vaccination status, allowing the company to constantly **monitor the health of their employees**, ensuring the workplace is a safe environment. 
- A **news section** showing the latest regulations by MOM, keeping administrators and employees alike updated and safe.
- **Email notifications** to keep users updated. Admins can receive emails in case of an employee testing positive on an ART test and users will be notified by email if they have yet to submit their ART test results
